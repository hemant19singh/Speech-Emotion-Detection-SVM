# Speech-Emotion-Detection-SVM
Detecting emotion for anyone's speech using SVM model and then tuning it using Grid Search CV

Dataset is uploaded because I couldn't find the Kaggle link.

Files/folders description:

1. speech_emotion_file : This is a folder and it contains the the main code but it is seperated into 8 different files because Github is not allowing me upload the files greater than 25mb and this file's size is 52mb. Extract the first compressed part (speech_emotion_jupyter_file.part01) and the full file will be extracted. Make sure all the compressed parts are present in the same folder before extracting the first part.
2. speech-emotion-recognition-ravdess-data : This folder contains the dataset for training.
3. Speech_emotion_model.pkl : This is the saved model which was exported using pickle from main jupyter file which is compressed and seperated into 8 different parts.
